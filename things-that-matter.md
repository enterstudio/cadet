things that i care about:

* visualize issue references
* how many reactions/comments
* project
* age
* who had last word
* labels
* anti-pattern
* milestone
* has the author ever submitted a PR
* subscribers? (is that the same as 'participants'?)

features that i care about:

* lasso/multi-select labeling
* assigning to projects
* force-directed graph would probably be nice
* dragging issues around (brownie points for persisting it)
